# Air Canvas

Air Canvas is an interactive computer vision project that allows users to draw in the air using just their fingers. This project uses a webcam to capture the user's hand movements and track their position in real-time. The user can then draw on the screen by moving their finger in the air, and the drawing will appear on the screen.
